What better way to showcase what our API can do than to build a feature on top of it. Well, that's exactly what we did this past month and are excited to showcase a no-code solution that allows anyone to create their own custom token-gated event page.

Here's what's included:

** 1. Offer exclusive event access for your token holders:**
Create your own branded token-gated event page to share with attendees. Your guests can then download their tickets as Apple Wallet or Google Pay passes. Token-gate against any ERC-721 or ERC-1155 smart contract deployed on Ethereum or Polygon.

** 2. Automate POAP Claims:**
Add your claim codes to our platform and a POAP will automatically be sent to the attendee once their ticket has been scanned and verified.

** 3. Scan tickets using your phone camera or the MetaMask app:**
Easily add multiple ticket verifiers to scan tickets at your event.
