Welcome to ETHPass! We are building a platform that allows you to tie any NFT to a customizable Apple Wallet pass. This idea was born out of the NFC tags that have emerged as a solution to bring NFTs into the physical world. We wanted to take this a step further and give token holders access to their NFTs with just a tap on their phones.

We have a list of ideas and use cases but our primary focus for this service is on token-gated content and events, which are becoming increasingly popular. 

**Here are two examples:**

1. An art gallery is hosting an event specifically for holders of a certain NFT. Instead of manually checking to make sure each attendee actually owns the NFT, the host would just scan the QR code on the attendee’s wallet pass and immediately verify ownership of the token, thus validating entry to the event. 

3. A DAO is creating exclusive content for specific token holders. They would just ask the token holders to install the pass for that token on their devices, and once they see that it has been downloaded, they immediately grant access to the content.   


Security and validity are of utmost importance when using this service, and we’ve designed the platform to ensure that the passes reflect the most current status of the token at any point in time. 

We are currently testing the beta version of our platform and would love to hear from you if you’re interested in trying it out. Sign up below and be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/ethpass) for more updates!
