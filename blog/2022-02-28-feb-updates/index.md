title: February Updates
---

We've received a lot of great feedback this past month and have been working hard to make the necessary updates to meet the needs of our early beta users. Here's a quick overview of the updates from this past month.

** 1. ERC-1115 Support:**  Users can now create a wallet pass from an ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token. A pass tied to an ERC-1155 token will remain valid as long as the user is in possession of at least one token. 

** 2. Ethereum Testnet & L2 Support:** We added support for Ethereum testnets Ropsten, Rinkeby, GÃ¶rli, Kovan Testnet, alongside L2 chains Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum and their respective testnets. We will continue to add support for other L2 chains by request.

** 3. Google Pay Passes:** Android users can now install passes through Google Pay.

The focus for the next month will be to build demos to show different ways of using ETHPass.
