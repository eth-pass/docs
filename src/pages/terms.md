## 6\. Reporting Intellectual Property Infringement

A. DMCA Notice for Copyright Infringement.

ETHPass will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), as set forth below. If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that the copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting of it as part of User-Generated Content on the Website, then you may send us a written notice, which notice must include all of the following:

(1) a subject line that says: “DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice”; and

(2) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; and

(3) a description of the location of the infringing material on the Website; and

(4) your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address; and

(5) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the allegedly infringing material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner; and

(6) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner); and

(7) your physical signature or, if sent within an email (rather than in a physical document or a digital document attached to an email), the characters “//s//” followed by your full typed name, which will serve as your electronic signature.

ETHPass may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and ETHPass may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.

ETHPass will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, e-mail or facsimile at the addresses below:

By Mail: 44 Portland St, Ste 400,Worcester, MA 01608

By E-Mail: [info@ethpass.xyz](mailto:info@ethpass.xyz)

We may send the information that you provide in your DMCA Notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.

Without limiting ETHPass's other rights, ETHPass may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer’s access to the Website and any other website owned or operated by ETHPass.

B. DMCA Counter-Notification regarding Copyright Infringement.

If access on the Services to a work that you submitted to ETHPass is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above. Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:

(1) a subject line that says: “DMCA Counter-Notification”; and

(2) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared on the Website before it was removed or disabled; and

(3) a statement made under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification; and

(4) your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account; and

(5) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and

(6) your physical signature or, if sent within an email (rather than in a physical document or a digital document attached to an email), the characters “//s//” followed by your full typed name, which will serve as your electronic signature.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than 10 and not more than 14 business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Website. You should also be aware that we may forward the DMCA Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

C. Reporting Infringement of Other Intellectual Property.

If you own intellectual property other than a copyright and believe that your intellectual property has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it on the Services, then you may send ETHPass a written notice to one of the addresses set forth in Section 4.A. above that includes all of the following:

(1) a subject line that says: “Intellectual Property Infringement Notice”; and

(2) a description of the intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or a list of the intellectual property if multiple works have been infringed; and

(3) a description of the location of the infringing material on the Website; and

(4) your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address; and

(5) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the allegedly infringing material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner; and

(6) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the owner (or, if you are not the owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner); and

(7) your physical signature or, if sent within an email (rather than in a physical document or a digital document attached to an email), the characters “//s//” followed by your full typed name, which will serve as your electronic signature.

ETHPass will act on such notices in its sole discretion. Any User of the Website that fails to respond satisfactorily to ETHPass with regard to any such notice is subject to suspension or termination. We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing material.

A. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California. Disputes arising under this Agreement shall proceed through three levels of resolution, if necessary: negotiations between you and ETHPass, mandatory mediation, and court proceedings. Any dispute which arises under this Agreement and cannot be resolved by good-faith negotiations between the parties within ninety (90) days must be submitted for a mandatory mediation procedure in San Francisco, California before a neutral mediator chosen and appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”). The mediation shall take place on within forty-five (45) days after the mediator has been appointed, and at the direction of the mediator. The mediation shall take place on one business day and shall last no longer than ten (10) hours unless the parties mutually agree to an extension of the mediation procedure. The mediator shall apply U.S. and California law to substantive issues and the JAMS procedural rules for Commercial Mediation to procedural issues. The parties shall bear their own costs for the mediation, and they shall split equally the costs and fees of the mediator. If either party is unsatisfied with the resolution provided by the mediator, either party may file a claim in the appropriate state or federal court sitting in the Northern District of California. You hereby consent and absolutely agree to the jurisdiction of state and federal courts sitting in the Northern District of California for resolving any disputes arising under this Agreement which cannot be resolved either by negotiations or by mediation between you and ETHPass.

(2) Your Waiver of Injunctive or Equitable Relief.

C. International Issues.

ETHPass controls and operates the Website from its offices in California, U.S.A. ETHPass makes no representation that the Website is appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A. If you use the Services from other locations, you are doing so of your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws regarding your online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent local laws apply. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, ETHPass reserve the right to limit the availability of, restrict access to, or discontinue the Services and/or any Content, program, product, service, or other feature described or available on or in the Services to any person, entity, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in ETHPass's sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service, or other feature that ETHPass provides. Some content, programs, services, or features may be available on this or only on a subscription or fee basis.

D. Severability and Interpretation.

If any provision of this Agreement is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement (which will remain in full force and effect). To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter. Wherever the word “including” is used in this Agreement, the word will be deemed to mean “including, without limitation.”

E. Communications.

Whenever you communicate with ETHPass electronically, such as via e-mail and text message, you consent to receive communications from ETHPass electronically. Please note that, except as set forth in the provisions of this Agreement regarding the DMCA, we are not obligated to respond to inquiries that we receive. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

F. Law Enforcement and Termination of Accounts or of the Website.

ETHPass reserves the right, without any limitation, to investigate any suspected breaches of its Website security or its information technology or other systems or networks, investigate any suspected breaches of this Agreement, investigate any information obtained by ETHPass in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with criminal laws, involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, prosecute violators of this Agreement, and discontinue the Website, in whole or in part, or suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party. Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to ETHPass under this Agreement. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Website, or upon notice from ETHPass, all rights granted to you under this Agreement will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Website. The provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to ETHPass in this Agreement, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.

G. Assignment.

ETHPass may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any advance notice to you or other Users. This Agreement may not be assigned by you in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of ETHPass.

H. No Waiver.

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no failure or delay by you or ETHPass in exercising any rights or remedies under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of that or any other right or remedy.

I. No Partnership or Joint Venture.

Neither this Agreement, nor any terms and conditions contained herein shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, franchise or agency relationship between you and ETHPass.

J. Complete Agreement.

This Agreement contains your entire understanding with ETHPass with respect to the subject matters covered by this Agreement, and it supersedes any and all prior oral or written proposals or understandings.
